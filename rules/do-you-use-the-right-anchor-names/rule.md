An anchor name is the value of either the name or id attribute when used in the context of anchors.

According to [SSW](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/) and [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html), Anchor names must observe the following rules: 
- Uniqueness: Anchor names must be unique within a document. 
- ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ```([A-Za-z])``` and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ```([0-9])```, hyphens ```("-")```, underscores ```("_")```, colons ```(":")```, and periods ```(".")```
- Anchor name cannot start with ```#```
